TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_pl_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_pl_0 and clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.

CLKC-32#1 Advisory
MMCME4 CLKOUT with phase shift drives no IOs  
The MMCME4 cell design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has non-zero CLKOUT1_PHASE phase-shift for CLKOUT1, but that clock output does not drive an I/O. Using a phase-shift is not a recommended method for internal paths timing closure and it also uses more power.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) design_1_i/zynq_ultra_ps_e_0/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
